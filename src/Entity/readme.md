# Info

This time do not create any entities before actually planning the database structure a bit
- singular names for tables and columns

# Tables self notes

1. Will need definitely
- table to store the credentials for each tool as I want this to be configurable in GUI,


# Other notes

1. Use the EntityInterface (just in case to be able to track the entities based classes like in PMS)
