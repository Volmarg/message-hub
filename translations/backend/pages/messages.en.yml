          <i>
            Allows to test given sending email directly without saving it in the database (default connection is used).
            Keep in mind that E-mails used for testing messages sending might be banned/suspended by the Mailbox itself
            due to excessive spamming - this will result in internal error as the mailbox will no longer be reachable.
